# Project Summary
This project is my exploration of the PS/2 interface. Through this project I am learning about how the PS/2 protocol worked.

## Project Goal
My goal for this project is to receive data being sent from the PS/2 mouse and use an arduino as a way to decode and translate it into commands that control my cursor on my computer, essentially creating a PS/2 to USB interface.
